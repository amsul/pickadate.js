## Upgrading from v2 to v3

The v3 API is significantly different from v2 (all for the greater good!). So if you’re upgrading to v3, make sure to read the [changelog](https://github.com/amsul/pickadate.js/blob/gh-pages/CHANGELOG.md).





<br>
## Library files

The `lib` folder includes all the compiled files and a `compressed` folder with the minified counter-parts.

### Pickers

There are currently two pickers: **date** and **time**.

File                    | Contents                 | Size (min & gzip)
----------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------
`picker.js`             | __Base *__               | 1.27kb
`picker.date.js`        | Date picker              | 1.91kb
`picker.time.js`        | Time picker              | 1.30kb

__*__ The base script is **required** for any of the pickers to function.

_To support old browsers, namely IE8, **also include** the `legacy.js` file._


### Themes

All themes are [generated using LESS](#less-styling) and compiled into the `lib/themes` folder.

File                    | Contents                 | Size (min & gzip)
----------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------
`default.css`           | __Base default *__       | 0.49kb
`default.date.css`      | Default date picker      | 0.69kb
`default.time.css`      | Default time picker      | 0.35kb
`classic.css`           | __Base classic *__       | 0.32kb
`classic.date.css`      | Classic date picker      | 0.69kb
`classic.time.css`      | Classic time picker      | 0.35kb

__*__ One and only one base stylesheet is **required**. [Choose a theme](http://amsul.github.io/pickadate.js) then include the respective pickers as well.

### Translations

The translations are copied into the `lib/translations` folder. There are currently [30 languages](https://github.com/amsul/pickadate.js/blob/v3.1.0/lib/translations) included.

## Styling with LESS

The picker themes are built using [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) with Grunt. To customize the CSS output, read the `_variables.less` file in the `_raw/lib/themes` folder. You can specify:

- colors for the theme,
- sizes for the picker,
- media-query breakpoints,
- and a whole bunch of other stuff.


After making any changes, run `grunt less:themes` to compile it into CSS.



<br>
## Versioning

To maintain some consistency in the sort of changes to expect with version bumps, [Semantic Versioning guidelines](http://semver.org/) will now be followed as closely as possible:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

Constructed as such:

- `major`: breaks backward compatibility (resets the `minor` and `patch`)
- `minor`: new additions with backward compatibility (resets the `patch`)
- `patch`: bug fixes and misc changes

- `npm install` to get the required node modules.
- `grunt --verbose` to confirm you have all the dependencies.


Read the Gruntfile to see the build tasks and relative directories of the source files.
