## Bug reports

If you believe you’ve found a bug within the repository code:

- Search the existing issues to avoid duplicates and to check if it has already been solved.
- Make sure you’re using the latest build.
- Isolate the problem and create a [reduced test case](http://css-tricks.com/6263-reduced-test-cases/) - preferably supported with a live example.
- Try to be as detailed as possible in the report (OS, browser, expected outcome vs actual outcome, etc).
- Please **do not** use the issue tracker for personal support requests. Instead try [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) or the likes.

## Pull requests

If you’re submitting a pull request, please respect the coding standards used (indentations, comments, semi-colons, etc) as per the **Golden Rule**:

> All code in any code base should look like a single person typed it, no matter how many people contributed.

A few other things to keep in mind:

- Make sure the changes are suitable within the scope of this project.
- Discuss any significant features before endeavoring into developing them. I’d hate to have anyone spend effort on something only for me to not merge it into the main project.
- Include the relevant test coverage if any JavaScript files are involved.
- Compile the project using `grunt --verbose` to make sure everything passes with a green flag.
- Use the Semantic Versioning guide, as mentioned in the [readme file](/blob/v3.0.0/README.md), in the case that a version bump is due.


#### All pull requests should be submitted to the `dev` branch.
