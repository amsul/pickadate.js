## Browser support

The `pickadate.js` script supports all modern browsers and IE 9+.

If you're sending in a pull request, to keep life simpler, send it in to the [dev](https://github.com/amsul/pickadate.js/tree/dev) branch.

### Roadmap ahead

I'm working on a rewrite for 3.0 that introduces a time picker, resolves a few issues, and makes it easier to extend the picker. This means that I won't be doing any more updates to the version 2.* build - except for any urgent issues that may arise.
